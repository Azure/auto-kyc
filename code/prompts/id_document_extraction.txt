When verifying identification documents, companies typically collect the following types of information depending on the type of ID presented:

### **Types of Identification Documents:**

   - Passport Photo (check if exists)

2. **Driver’s License:**
   - Full Name
   - License Number
   - Date of Birth
   - Nationality
   - Address

3. **National ID Card:**

   - National ID Number
   - Date of Birth

4. **Social Security Card (where applicable):**

   - Issue Date (if present)
   - Card Type (if specified)

These identification documents are assessed to extract the following key information, which must be presented in your output **JSON**:

### **Key Information to Extract:**

1. **Full Name** (First, Middle, Last)
2. **Date of Birth**
3. **Nationality**
4. **Identification Numbers**:
   - Passport Number (only if document is a passport)
   - Driver’s License Number (only if document is a driver license)
   - National ID Number (only if document is a national ID)
   - Social Security Number (only if document is an SSN)
5. **Issue and Expiry Dates** of the document
6. **Place of Issue** (if available)
7. **MRZ Code** (for Passports)
8. **Gender** (if available)
9. **Address** (for documents that include an address, such as Driver’s Licenses or National ID Cards)
10. **Vehicle Class/Endorsements** (for Driver's Licenses)
11. **Attached Photos** (Passport, Driver’s License, ID Card, etc.) - check if they exist in the document
12. **Document Type** (e.g., Passport, Driver's License, etc.)

We will be processing the following document to extract the above-mentioned information:
## START OF IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENT
{document}
## END OF IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENT

Screenshot images of the document might also be attached with this prompt, so **MAKE SURE** to look there as well. You will be penalized if you miss any information either in the text section of the document included between ## START OF IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENT and ## END OF IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENT, or attached as images with this prompt.

The below is the extracted information from previous pages of the same document, to give you more context in extracting the remaining pages. If the below is empty, you can assume that you are starting with the first page(s):

## START OF EXTRACTED INFORMATION FROM PREVIOUS PAGES OF THE SAME DOCUMENT
{extracted}
## END OF EXTRACTED INFORMATION FROM PREVIOUS PAGES OF THE SAME DOCUMENT

### **Example Output:**

```json
{{
    "document_type": "Passport",
    "first_name": "John",
    "middle_name": "Michael",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "date_of_birth": "15.06.1985",
    "nationality": "American",
    "passport_number": "123456789", (only if document is a passport)
    "place_of_birth": "Los Angeles, California",
    "passport_issue_date": "01.01.2018",
    "passport_expiry_date": "31.12.2028",
    "passport_place_of_issue": "California, USA",
    "passport_mrz_code": "P<USADOE<<JOHN<MICHAEL<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<",
    "photo": "True",
    "signature": "True"
}}
```

In this example, we extracted data from a **Passport** document, including the individual's full name, passport number, date of birth, nationality, place of birth, issue and expiry dates, place of issue, and MRZ code. The passport photo has been confirmed that it exists in the passport.

If the document were a Driver’s License or National ID Card, relevant fields such as license number, vehicle class, address, and ID card number would be extracted similarly.

### **Other Considerations:**
If the document contains multiple pages or sections (e.g., front and back of a Driver’s License), ensure that all sections are processed, and any available information is included in the final **JSON** output.
